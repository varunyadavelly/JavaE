Classes Notes:

In Java, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. 
It defines the data and behavior that objects of the class will have.

A Class can have Data members and methods:

Data members can be of any type including primitive types arrays or even other objects.

Methods: define the type of behavior or operations that a class can perform.  can also manipulate and perform
various operations on data members.

 
CONSTRUCTORS:

Classes can also have constructors, special methods which that are invoked when an object of the class is 
created. Constructors are used to initialize the state of objects.

ex: public Car(String brand, String model, int year) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
    
    Car myCar= new Car("Suzuki", "Baleno Alpha", 2019); //creating a new object
